    <h1>Hello!</h1>  
    <h2>My name is Noémi Kádas</h2> 
    <h3>Welcome to my site!</h3>
    <p>  I received my university degree from ELTE five years ago. I am an <strong><i>orientalist</i></strong>  . I work as an <strong><i>interpreter,</i> </strong> <strong><i>translator</i></strong>   and <strong><i>language teacher.</i></strong>  </p>
  
    <p>Before the pandemic, I had more lessons in person than online. This has changed due to the virus. I'm just teaching online now. The world of IT has started to interest me since i began looking for new ways how I can make my lessons more fascinating. I was looking for videos and useful informations from which I can learn the basics. So fortunately I  
         found an IT course and very professional colleagues as well.
         I think this course would be suitable for me because I am very hardworking and I really want to develop my set of skills in the field of IT.</p>
     <p>In the future i wish to expand my knowledge that i could find my ways as an IT developer and to reach new people with my language teaching.</p>
         <h3>Thank you for your consideration! </h3>
